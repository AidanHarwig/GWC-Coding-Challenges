Challenge #1:

Your task is to create a program that allows a user to input single-digit numbers into an array of integers. This array will represent a multi-digit integer, where the order of the array is identical to the order of the digits in the number.
Your goal is to increase this large integer by one and return the resulting array.

For example:

Given the numbers [1, 2, 3], the program should return [1, 2, 4].

Given the numbers [5, 7, 9], the program should return [5, 8, 0].
